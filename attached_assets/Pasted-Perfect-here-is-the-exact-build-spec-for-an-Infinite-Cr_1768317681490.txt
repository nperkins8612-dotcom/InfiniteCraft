Perfect — here is the **exact build spec** for an Infinite‑Craft‑style game **with zero AI**, written so you can drop it straight into a Replit project and build it exactly as intended.

This version uses **only predefined logic**, **no API calls**, **no randomness**, and **no external services**. Everything is deterministic and stored locally.

---

# 🔧 **BUILD THIS EXACT GAME (No‑AI Infinite Craft Clone)**

Below is the full, implementation‑ready description of how your game should work.

---

# 1. **Overall Structure**
You are building a **browser-based**, **HTML/CSS/JS** game with:

- A left panel containing all discovered elements  
- A large center canvas where tiles can be dragged  
- A top search bar  
- A trash bin for deleting tiles  
- A combination system that uses a **local dictionary** instead of AI  

Everything is saved in **localStorage**.

---

# 2. **Starting Elements**
Hardcode these four base elements:

```
Water
Fire
Earth
Air
```

Each element has:

```
id: string
name: string
icon: string (emoji)
```

Example:

```
{ id: "water", name: "Water", icon: "💧" }
```

---

# 3. **Tile Behavior**
Every tile on the canvas:

- Can be dragged  
- Can be dropped onto another tile  
- Can be clicked to duplicate  
- Can be deleted by dragging into the trash  

Tiles are **visual only** — no physics.

---

# 4. **UI Layout**
Build the screen like this:

### Left Panel
- Shows the 4 base elements pinned at the top  
- Shows all discovered elements below  
- Clicking an element spawns a tile on the canvas  

### Center Canvas
- White background  
- Free‑positioned tiles  
- No grid  
- Tiles stay where the user leaves them  

### Top Bar
- Search bar  
- Typing filters discovered elements  
- Clicking a result spawns a tile  

### Bottom Right
- Trash icon  
- Dropping a tile on it deletes that tile instance  

---

# 5. **Combination System (No AI)**

This is the core of your game.

You need a **combination dictionary**:

```
{
  "water|fire": "Steam",
  "water|earth": "Mud",
  "fire|earth": "Lava",
  "air|fire": "Smoke",
  ...
}
```

### Rules:

1. **Normalize the pair**  
   Sort alphabetically:

```
key = [idA, idB].sort().join("|")
```

2. **Check if the combo exists**
   - If yes → return the result element  
   - If no → generate a fallback name  

### Fallback Name Generator (No AI)
Use simple deterministic rules:

- If both are objects → combine names:

```
"Water" + "Tree" → "Water Tree"
```

- If one is abstract → prefix:

```
"Fire" + "Idea" → "Fiery Idea"
```

- If nothing matches → default:

```
"{A} {B}"
```

**Important:**  
Once a fallback name is generated, **save it permanently** in the combination dictionary so the same pair always gives the same result.

---

# 6. **Element Creation**
When a new element is created:

1. Assign it a unique ID  
2. Add it to the discovered list  
3. Add it to the left panel  
4. Save it in localStorage  
5. Spawn a tile on the canvas  

---

# 7. **Saving System**
Save these three things in localStorage:

### 1. Discovered Elements
```
elements = {
  "water": {...},
  "fire": {...},
  ...
}
```

### 2. Combination Dictionary
```
combinations = {
  "water|fire": "steam",
  ...
}
```

### 3. Canvas Tiles
Each tile instance:

```
{
  instanceId,
  elementId,
  x,
  y
}
```

---

# 8. **Loading System**
On page load:

1. Load elements  
2. Load combinations  
3. Load canvas tiles  
4. If nothing exists, initialize with the 4 base elements  

---

# 9. **Tile Combining Animation**
When combining:

- Flash both tiles  
- Remove them  
- Spawn the new tile with a small “pop” animation  

---

# 10. **Minimal Starter Combination List**
Use these to make early gameplay feel smart:

```
water + fire → steam
water + earth → mud
water + air → cloud
fire + earth → lava
fire + air → smoke
earth + air → dust
earth + plant → tree
water + plant → algae
fire + plant → ash
```

You can add more, but this is enough to start.

# 11. **What You Will Put on Replit**
Your Replit project will contain:

```
index.html
style.css
script.js
```

And everything above will be implemented in JavaScript.

If you want, I can generate:

- The **full folder structure**
- A **starter template**
- The **entire script.js skeleton**
- The **drag-and-drop system**
- The **combination engine**
- The **localStorage manager**
- The **UI rendering functions**

Just tell me and I’ll build the whole starter project for you.
